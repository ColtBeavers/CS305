Artemis Financial is a consulting company that focususes on financial planning. They were interested in modernizing by upgrading to more effective software security. 
I felt like I did a good job at being able to highlight areas in code that were needing to be adjusted to help with secuirty. Coding securly is very important to the overall process, as it projects both the users, and the systems from attackers. Software security shows it's value by project software owners from being open to attacks.
I found a lot of this course challenging, but I particularly found flagging false positives on dependency checks difficult. 
I increased layers of securitys by learning several new techniques, including hash and crytography algorithms. I plan continue to use these techniques in the future. 
I struggled a lot with being certain if the code was secure, and to be frank, am unsure if it is. 
I believe for myself, just more practice and time would absolutely be the best resource I could provide myself in this area. 
What I think I might show future employers from this assignment is my ability to learn and grow. I think when I look back at it in a few months, I will be prouder of the quality of work I am outputting then than what I am outputting now. Perhaps I will use it as an oppurtunity to come bakc and refactor this work.
